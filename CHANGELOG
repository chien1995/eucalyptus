- Added new networking subsystem that no longer depends on VDE
- Added support for elastic IP assignment and security using the 'MANAGED'
  networking mode
- Cluster controller scheduling policy can now be configured in
  eucalyptus.conf (ROUNDROBIN and GREEDY currently supported)
- Cluster controller now handles concurrent requests (no longer have to
  restrict apache to allow only one connection at a time)
- Added Walrus: a Amazon S3 interface compatible storage manager. Walrus handles 
  storage of user data as well as filesystem images, kernels, and ramdisks. 
- Support for new operations: 
  - Reboot instance and get console output.
- Node Controller improvements:
  - Retrieval of images from Walrus instead of NFS-mounted file system
  - New caching and cleanup code, including start-time integrity checks
  - On-the-fly script-based generation of libvirt XML configuration
  - Script-based discovery of node resources (no assumptions about stat)
  - MAX_CORES overrides actual number of cores both down and up
  - Moved libvirt errors to nc.log and suppressed harmless ones
  - Serialized some Xen invocations to guard against non-determinism
  - Added proper swap creation, also "ephemeral" disk support
  - More robust instance state reporting to Cluster Controller
- Web interface improvements:
  - Added cloud/Walrus configuration, including clusters and VM types
  - Revamped 'credentials' tab with new options to edit user information
    and hide/show "secret" strings
  - Editing of user information for the administrator, including
    confirmation dialog for deletion of users
  - User-initiated password recovery mechanism
  - Fixed a couple of bugs: ' ' in username, spurious double additions
- Revamped logging throughout, with five levels a la log4j
- Cloud Controller:
  - User, Cluster, and System keys are now stored in PKCS#12 keystores and have moved to var/lib/eucalyptus/keys
  - Configuration is handled entirely through the web interface
    - Clusters dynamically added/started/stopped
    - Webservices operations complete up to EC2 2008-05-05 (w/o EBS):
    - "Elastic IP" address support
    - Image registration and attribute manipulation
    - GetConsole and RebootInstances support
    - Working Security Groups support for clusters in MANAGED network mode
    - see website for additional details, extensions, and caveats:
      http://open.eucalyptus.com/wiki/API_v1.4
  - Instance Metadata service (including userData)
  - Workaround to use standard tools for registering kernels & ramdisks

- Cluster Controller improvements:
   - Instance caching added to improve performance under
     certain conditions
   - Thread locks removed to improve performance
   - NC resource information gathered asynchronously to
     improve scheduler performance
- Network control improvements:
   - Added ability to configure 'public' instance interface
     network parameters (instead of hardcoded 10. network)
   - Lots of reliability changes
- Cloud Controller improvements:
   - Pure in-memory database
   - Image registration over WS interface
   - Improved build procedure
- Web interface improvements:
    - For all users (query interface credentials, listing of

    - For the administrator (addition, approval, disabling,
      and deletion of users; disabling of images)
- Numerous bug fixes, improving stability and performance.
   In particular, but not limited to:
