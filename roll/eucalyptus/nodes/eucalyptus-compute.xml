	<description>
	EUCALYPTUS is an open source service overlay that implements
	elastic computing using existing resources. The goal of
	EUCALYPTUS is to allow sites with existing clusters and server
	infrastructure to co-host an elastic computing service that is
	interface-compatible with Amazon's EC2.

	$Log: eucalyptus-compute.xml,v $
	Revision 1.15  2008-12-09 21:24:33  graziano
	More tweaking for the new euca_conf

	Revision 1.14  2008-07-30 02:06:37  graziano
	moved euca_conf to sbin. We need to create the instance path even when
	the nc is not running.

	Revision 1.13  2008-07-29 06:35:41  graziano
	forgot -d option for euca_conf in the postinstall for the roll.

	Revision 1.12  2008-07-29 06:29:43  graziano
	Compatected a bit the roll postinstall. Added creation of the path to the
	compute node.

	Revision 1.11  2008-07-29 01:36:44  graziano
	Let's be sure we leave the configuration file in the better shape we can.
	Modified the rolls postinstall to accomodate the missing socat and the
	new way to configure eucalyptus.

	Revision 1.10  2008-07-27 21:08:03  graziano
	getting ready for the rolls

	Revision 1.9  2008-07-26 07:11:32  graziano
	Squashed the last  few pesky error: got some workable RPMs out of it.
	Moved euca_conf in the same directory as add_key.sh, and rearranged the
	spec file to pick it up. Adjusted the rolls to use all the new eucalyptus
	rpms.

	Revision 1.8  2008-07-26 05:29:43  graziano
	Moved to 1.2. Split the eucalyptus package in 4: eucalyptus, -cloud, -cc
	and -nc, started to rework the roll to accomodate that. Adjusted the
	dependencies to be more sane. euca_conf could be use to finish the setup
	(creating repositories and adding default cluster). euca_sync_key can now
	sync single hosts. The init.d script check to see if the configuration
	file has indeed been configured, and removed the sync_key script from
	there.

	Revision 1.7  2008-07-23 20:23:20  graziano
	First cut at moving to /opt/eucalyptus. CLeaned up the postinstall script
	in the rolls and the init.d: we just use whatever directory is in
	/etc/default/eucalyptus (not hardcoded /opt/eucalyptus ...).

	Revision 1.6  2008-07-02 03:14:28  graziano
	need to export EUCALYPTUS variable before calling ant

	Revision 1.5  2008-07-02 01:35:02  graziano
	we need to source /etc/default/eucalyptus ...

	Revision 1.4  2008-07-02 00:42:18  graziano
	we cannot start after having installed the RPM since we didn't configure
	yet what to start. We can start after the roll got installed though.

	Revision 1.3  2008-07-01 21:57:10  graziano
	moving the rocks command into the roll's postinstall

	Revision 1.2  2008-05-26 21:56:41  graziano
	we need out apache2 compile with -DBIG_SECURITY_HOLE to run as root.
	Added dependency for the roll.

	Revision 1.1  2008-05-21 04:36:28  graziano
	Let's try to make different installations for compute and frontend: step
	towards having more rpms.

	Revision 1.4  2008-05-20 03:50:07  graziano
	Put ant jce in the right spot. Added the call to put the runlevels. Added
	xen-libs to the package list. Added stubs for euca for cluster controller
	management.

	Revision 1.3  2008-05-12 19:04:01  graziano
	added some eucalyptus descriptions: waiting for rich for the copyright
	part.

	Revision 1.2  2008-05-11 23:07:34  graziano
	Modified the copyright (removed for now). Added euca-libvirt and euca-vde
	into the roll.

	Revision 1.1.1.1  2008-05-11 23:01:22  graziano
	I need a place to put the roll source tree
